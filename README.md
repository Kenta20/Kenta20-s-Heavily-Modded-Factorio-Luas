# Kenta20's Heavily Modded Factorio Luas
I haven't the faintest idea what I'm doing. print('Hello, World!')...?

tl;dr @ end
Okay, so I've had some time to read things and test things and I've come up with some things!
Basically, I went down an insane rabbit hole. I played a bit of vanilla factorio aaaaages ago, and I loved it. 
Started again recently, and got completely into mods. Currently, I'm messing with BZ and a bunch of misc ones.
I discovered that curcuits are SO much fun. And trains. I love trains. 
Which means, naturally, I went to AAI Programmable Structures/Vehicles.
The non-video guides (cuz who actually wants to watch a whole video when 1 paragraph will do?) were sparse and (sorry Earendel) kinda confusing and useless. Granted, they're from 2016.
So, I decided to figure it out on my own. Which meant circuits. I hate circuits (wait, what?).
So, I went on the mods page and got a whole bunch of circuit stuff. Including Moon Logic. Which does Lua stuff. What on Earth is Lua?
Well, it is *literally* not on Earth, Lua is Moon in Portuguese, but in this context, it's a programming language! Apparently, Roblox uses it, too! 
Which makes me wonder, what the heck is Roblox I thought it was like. Minigames for 10 year olds? Might have to look into that since I'm a huge fan of ridiculously modded Minecraft, which is another "isn't that for kids?" game.
LUA! Went down a rabbit hole. Bought a book. Anxiously awaiting its arrival. Played with Moon Logic. I can now automate The Things.
I think I've come up with the most efficient way of scanning the tiles, assigning the zones, and sending the miners to the zones. It has taken me far too long to finally get to this point.
Working on the next bits now! Specifically, getting the haulers to go to the miners. And I'm a cheapskate, so 1 or 2 haulers in a depot, listening for full miners. Shouldn't be hard, right? It's only taken me like 3 weeks to get from "WHY WON'T THIS MINER MOVE" to "I made a thing that does everything in 1 block :)"

tl;dr I made a few scripts that go in Moon Logic combinators that can automate AAI Programmable Vehicles/Structures to scan tiles for resources, assign zones to those resources, and send miners to those zones.

PS this is totally what a readme is for right
PPS Programming is so much fun why didn't anyone FORCE me to do this yeeeeeeears ago??

7/3 I'll upload them tomorrow! Gotta sleep now cuz it's 1:15am! The factory must grow!
